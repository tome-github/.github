## Reviewer Section
* Does the PR title clearly describe what the PR does?
* Does the commit body describe what happened in required detail? (required detail may be none)
* Are there any breaking changes, and if so, are they documented?
* Are unit tests added (if applicable)?
* Does the code follow our coding standards?
  * e.g. naming conventions adhered, no copy/paste, readable, function names describe the behavior
* Is the documentation still correct? (function descriptions, readme, etc)
* [ ] I, $reviewer, swear upon pain of feeling shame, that the above have been checked and are correct

Note: Do not press green "squash and merge" or whatever it may say button, add label `automerge` to cause the pr to be automagically merged with the commit message from the PR.
